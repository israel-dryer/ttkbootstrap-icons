# Changelog

All notable changes to `tkinter-icons-fluent` are documented in this file.
The base package keeps its own changelog at the root of the repository.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This pack was published as `ttkbootstrap-icons-fluent` through 1.0.x and renamed
to `tkinter-icons-fluent` in 1.1.0. Entries before 1.1.0 were reconstructed from
git history after the fact and are summaries rather than contemporaneous notes.

## [1.1.1] — an intro in this library's voice

No glyph, font or metrics change: this release exists to correct text that PyPI freezes at release time.

### Changed

- **The README intro and the distribution summary are written from this library's side, not upstream's.** Both opened with the pack as "a provider for `tkinter-icons`" — `provider` is the developer API that #79 deliberately split out of the public surface, and nobody installing a pack ever touches a `BaseFontProvider`. The rest carried upstream's own description of the font, including framing this project exists to keep users away from. They now say what the set covers and when to reach for it, which is what a PyPI landing page has to answer. (#120)

## [1.1.0] — measured ink metrics, and the tkinter-icons rename

Requires `tkinter-icons>=5.0.0`. Install it as an extra rather than by name:

```bash
pip install "tkinter-icons[fluent]"
```

### Added

- **`metrics.json`, the measured ink bounds for every glyph in this pack.** The
  5.0.0 renderer centers on true ink instead of on Pillow's `font.getbbox()`,
  which under-reports it on icon fonts. Without this file the pack still
  renders, by falling back to `getbbox`; with it, full-bleed icons keep their
  padding and everything else sits centered. Regenerate with
  `python -m tkinter_icons.tools.generate_metrics fluent` whenever the font or
  glyph map changes. (#67)

- **The icon class takes `options`.** `RenderOptions` carries every drawing knob — padding, oversampling, sharpening, even-snapping — and was reachable only through `Icon.render_pil` or the base `Icon`, not through the class you actually construct. `FluentIcon("name", size=32, options=RenderOptions(pad_factor=0.0))` now works. Keyword-only, so it cannot be confused with `style`.

- **`render_pil` works on this class without a warm-up.** It read an icon set shared by every subclass, so `FluentIcon.render_pil(...)` drew this pack's glyphs only if something had already constructed one of its icons — and raised in a fresh process. The class names its own provider now, and resolves friendly names the way the constructor does.

### Changed

- **Renamed from `ttkbootstrap-icons-fluent`.** The old distribution is frozen at
  1.0.x and keeps working against a 4.x base package; it will not be updated.
  (#75)

- **The entry point moved to the `tkinter_icons.providers` group.** The base
  package scans the old group as well, so a mixed set of old and new packs stays
  discoverable. (#75)

### Removed

- **The `tkicons-fluent-build` and `tkicons-fluent-quick` commands, and the
  `tools` module behind them.** They regenerate this pack's assets from
  upstream sources, so they only work against a source checkout — from an
  installed wheel they did nothing but occupy two names on every user's PATH.
  Nothing imports them at runtime. Maintainers run them from the repository.
  (#79)

## [1.0.0] — one provider API

### Changed

- **Rewritten against the single provider API introduced in base 3.0.0.** Names,
  styles, and display names resolve the same way here as in every other pack,
  whether a style is passed as an argument or carried in the icon name. (#31)

### Added

- **A visual test** covering the pack's styles. (#32)

## [0.2.0] — typed styles

### Changed

- **The `style` argument is typed,** so its accepted values are visible to a
  type checker and an editor rather than only in the docs. (#21)

## [0.1.0] — initial release

### Added

- **Fluent System Icons as a font-based provider,** with its asset generation tooling.
